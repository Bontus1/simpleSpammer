# simpleSpammer
A simple python program that spams a message. I originally made this for discord but I later realized that this could be used elsewhere aswell.
It works by copying and pasting whatever you input. I made it press enter twice so that you can tag people on discord easier.

This program for some reason only works on windows at the moment, however I will try to make it work on linux aswell.

Installation:
run pip install -r requirements.txt
