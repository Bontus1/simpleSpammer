# simpleSpammer
A simple python program that spams a message. I originally made this for discord but I later realized that this could be used elsewhere aswell.
It works by copying and pasting whatever you input. I made it press enter twice so that you can tag people on discord easier.

This program works for linux and windows. 

Installation:
run ´pip install requirements.txt´
